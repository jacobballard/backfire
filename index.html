<p>
From the perspective of a small business, the best way to grow website revenue is to sell to preexisting customers.  
Consistently higher (up to 300% compared to new users) conversion rates for returning users and
a majority share of revnue clearly show this.  <br>
  
A misunderstanding people have about my cause is that the best way to generate new revenue on a website is by getting new customers.
